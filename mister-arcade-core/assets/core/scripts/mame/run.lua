-- Bootstrap that makes Lua failures VISIBLE to the calling script.
--
-- MAME reports a broken autoboot script with a modal dialog. Headless, that is
-- close to invisible: the process sits on the dialog until something kills it,
-- the capture directory looks untouched, and the only symptom is "it quietly
-- did nothing" -- a syntax error from a stray newline inside a string literal,
-- and a runtime error after an edit deleted a function still being called.
--
-- This wrapper catches both classes and writes them to a file the Python
-- runner reads back, so a Lua fault becomes a printed error instead of a hunt:
--
--   syntax errors    loadfile() returns nil plus a message, BEFORE any of the
--                    target script runs. pcall cannot catch these, because
--                    there is nothing to call yet -- it has to be loadfile.
--   runtime errors   pcall around the call, and again around each frame
--                    notifier, since an error inside a notifier is reported by
--                    MAME but does not reach the loader.
