"""Build the SDRAM image an `.mra` describes, the way mra-tools-c would.

Several zips per .mra: zip="a.zip|b.zip" (a set plus a BIOS zip).

Used by scripts/build_mra.py to CHECK its own output: the image an `.mra`
produces must be byte-identical to the one built directly from each driver's
ROM_START by scripts/build_maincpu_hex.py and scripts/prep_tilemap_tb.py --
which are independently verified against MAME's disassembly and against
rendered frames.

That check is the whole point. LESSONS_LEARNED is blunt about this: every
interleave on the Psikyo core that was DERIVED by reasoning about byte order
was wrong, and the one that worked came from copying a shipped core's idiom.
"It boots" is weak evidence, because a wrong map can boot far enough to look
plausible. So nothing here reasons about the map digits -- the semantics are
implemented once, and build_mra.py picks each region's map by testing which
one reproduces a known-good image.

Semantics implemented:

  <part name= .../>            the whole file, verbatim
  <part repeat="N">FF</part>   N bytes of the given filler
  <part>0A 0B</part>           literal bytes (used for the mod byte and for
                               hiscore configuration blocks)
  <interleave output="N">      N is BITS (16 or 32), so the output word is
                               N/8 bytes. Each child part carries a `map`
                               with one digit per output byte. A digit d != 0
                               means that output byte comes from byte (d-1)
                               of the part's chunk; 0 means the part does not
                               contribute there. A part's chunk size is its
                               number of non-zero digits.

    THIS IS THE ONE THING IN THIS FILE THAT MUST NOT BE REASONED ABOUT, so it
    is transcribed from the tool that actually consumes the `.mra` rather than
    derived. From mra-tools-c `src/mra.c`, `get_pattern_from_map()`:

        for (i = n - 1, j = 0; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (map[i] != '0') {

    byte that lands at output byte `map_index + j`. So:

    which is what docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md records, established the hard way on
