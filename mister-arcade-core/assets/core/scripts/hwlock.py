"""Keep JTAG and Quartus off this machine at the same time.

Shared by every MiSTer core on this PC -- one USB-Blaster, one Quartus, and
a marker outside any of the repos so all of them see each other.

Running a JTAG session (read_issp.tcl, a memory dump) while a Quartus
compile is in flight has bugchecked this PC (0x139, KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE)
three times. Enforced here rather than remembered. Both directions:

  * a JTAG tool refuses to start while Quartus OR ModelSim is running;
  * a build, or a simulation, refuses to start while a JTAG tool holds the
    marker.

Quartus and ModelSim are NOT a hazard to each other: builds and simulations
may run side by side, and several of either at once.

The marker is a file rather than a lock object because the JTAG side is a
mix of Python and quartus_stp Tcl, and a file is the only thing both can
agree on. It carries the pid and what the session was for, and a stale one
(whose pid is gone) is cleared automatically -- a crashed tool must not
wedge every later build.
