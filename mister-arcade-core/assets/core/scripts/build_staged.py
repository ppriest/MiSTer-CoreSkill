"""Build Quartus from a staged snapshot of HEAD, leaving the tree free.

A Quartus compile takes minutes, and for all of it the tree has to be left
alone. The compile runs in a dedicated git worktree at <repo>/build
(gitignored), so the main tree is free the moment the build starts, and every
scrap of Quartus scratch -- db/, incremental_db/, output_files/, the log --
lands under build/ instead of the repo root.

The build is exactly HEAD:
  * a dirty tree is refused by default, so what is in the editor and what is
    compiled cannot silently diverge. --allow-dirty builds HEAD anyway,
    explicitly acknowledging the uncommitted edits are EXCLUDED.
  * the built commit is written to build/BUILT_COMMIT beside the log, so
    every .rbf maps to one commit.

    python scripts/build_staged.py                     # compile HEAD, default revision
    python scripts/build_staged.py --rev <project>     # another revision
    python scripts/build_staged.py --seed 12345        # try another placement
    python scripts/build_staged.py --allow-dirty       # HEAD, ignoring edits

The revision defaults to CORE_REV, else the one .qsf, else the last
PROJECT_REVISION in the .qpf (scripts/coretools.py). A core with an
instrumented <project>_stp.qsf (DEBUG_ISSP) and a release <project>.qsf
builds the instrumented one by default when it is listed last.

Outputs, all inside the stage, named after the revision:
    build/q_staged.log                     the build log (deploy.py's gate reads it)
    build/output_files/<rev>.rbf           the bitstream
    build/output_files/<rev>.sta.summary
    build/BUILT_COMMIT                     commit, time and SEED

Deploy it by pointing deploy.py at the stage (its defaults):
    python scripts/deploy.py --rbf-only

The worktree persists between builds -- Quartus's db/ with it -- and each run
hard-resets it to HEAD. A .build_running marker refuses two overlapping
staged builds.

scripts/build.sh still builds in-tree; use it when you want the compile to
see uncommitted work and are willing to leave the tree alone.
